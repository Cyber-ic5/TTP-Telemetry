# TTP Telemetry

## Objective

The TTP Telemetry project was essentially constructed to illustrate the events generated by adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures. Primarily, this lab focused on creating telemetry via Atomic Red Team and ingesting the event logs into Splunk for dissection.

### Skills Learned

- Ability to interpret logs within a SIEM.
- Cultivation of logs related to attack patterns.
- Deployment of a Splunk server, forwarder, and interface.

### Tools Used

- Oracle VM
- Ubuntu (Server)
- Splunk/Universal Forwarder
- Powershell
- Sysmon
- Atomic Red Team
